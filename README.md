# Experimental Python Project

## Overview

This repository documents my hands-on experimentation with Python fundamentals and Git/GitHub workflows. The goal of this project is to **build consistent coding habits**, **practice version control**, and **demonstrate growth over time** rather than deliver a single finished application.

This repo is part of my public portfolio and shows how I structure projects, commit changes, and document my work.

---

## Project Goals

* Practice Python syntax and basic programming concepts
* Learn and apply Git & GitHub professionally
* Build a visible, traceable development history
* Develop discipline in committing meaningful changes

---

## Current Contents

* `main.py` — Entry point for Python experiments
* `First_text_file.txt` — Test file used to practice Git commits
* `First_file` — Initial experiment file

(Structure will evolve as the project grows.)

---

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Git** (version control)
* **GitHub** (remote repository & portfolio)
* **VS Code** (development environment)

---

## What I’ve Learned So Far

* Initializing and managing a Git repository
* Writing clear, incremental commit messages
* Connecting a local project to GitHub
* Understanding the difference between *saving*, *staging*, *committing*, and *pushing*

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/experimental-python-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder:

   ```bash
   cd experimental-python-project
   ```
3. Run the Python file:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Roadmap

Planned improvements:

* Add structured Python modules
* Include small utility scripts
* Improve documentation and comments
* Add unit tests

## About Me

I am actively developing my skills in programming and software development. This repository reflects my learning process and commitment to improving through consistent practice.

---

## Notes

This project is intentionally simple at this stage. The focus is **learning in public**, maintaining clean version control, and building a solid technical foundation.
